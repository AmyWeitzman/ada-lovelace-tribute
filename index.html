                    <li>Ada Lovelace was an English mathematician and writer known as one of the first computer programmers</li>
                    <li>She was the daughter of the famous poet, Lord Byron</li>
                    <li>As a child, Ada was taught math and science, which was unusual for a girl at that time</li>
                    <li>At the age of 17 she met Charles Babbage, known as the "father of computers"</li>
                    <li>While assisting Babbage with his work on the Analytical Engine, she developed the first computer algorithm</li>
                    <li>Ada saw much potential in the use of computers to program anything, not just performing mathematical computation</li>
                </ul>

                "Ada saw something that Babbage in some sense failed to see. In Babbage's world his engines were bound by number...What Lovelace saw...was that number could represent entities other than quantity. So once you had a machine for manipulating numbers, if those numbers represented other things, letters, musical notes, then the machine could manipulate symbols of which number was one instance, according to rules. It is this fundamental transition from a machine which is a number cruncher to a machine for manipulating symbols according to rules that is the fundamental transition from calculation to computation—to general-purpose computation—and looking back from the present high ground of modern computing, if we are looking and sifting history for that transition, then that transition was made explicitly by Ada in that 1843 paper." <br>
